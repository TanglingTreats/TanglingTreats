### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-stack engineer based in Singapore!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS, NextJS and focusing on front-end architecture and development. This will be in the form of my [portfolio and blogging platform](https://github.com/TanglingTreats/next-blog).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an educational project [NSSSH](https://github.com/TanglingTreats/NSSSH) aka Not Safe SSH. This is a project to improve my practical understanding of networking at a lower level.
